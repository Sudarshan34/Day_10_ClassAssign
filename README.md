Dear Team,

I have used html,css, js to complete this assignment, I have used divs, buttons and applied stylings using the css, while in the js I have taken the array of colors,
Using getElementById, the elements circle, colorButton, and shapeButton is  obtained from html,When clicked, the colorButton modifies the circle's background color,
The shapeButton switches between showing the different  shapes. The "active" class is used in order to display or hide shapes.
